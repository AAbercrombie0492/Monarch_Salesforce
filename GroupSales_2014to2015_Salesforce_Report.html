        <h1>Monarch Group-Sales Salesforce Data from November 2014 - April 2015</h1>


        <h2>Question 1: Where do our groups come from?</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550
        " frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/20.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>The Southern Colorado market is clustered in Salida, Pueblo, and Colorado Springs. Highest revenue groups are from wholesalers in Chaffee County. Few groups north of Castle Rock visited Monarch in the 2014-2015 season. Note the high revenue (red/blue, $2.2k and above) groups from Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Note the clusters in Kansas City, Wichita, Dodge City, Oklahoma City, and the Dallas/Fort Worth. Albuquerque may be a promising area to target business development/marketing efforts.</p>
          
        <h2>Question 2: How are group purchase totals distributed?</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/28.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>

        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/22.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>Group Sales purchases are highly left skewed with a majority of purchase sums ranging from $400 to $2000 dollars. Outliers span from $4,000 to $11,000 dollars.</p> 
         
         <h2>Question 3: Which packages are our groups buying? How does each package type contribute to total revenue?</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/16.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>Opportunities from the dataset were associated with a package type by binary classification, meaning that group leaders would specify whether anyone in the group intended to purchase rentals, lessons, etc. The dataset accounts for user input from Monarch’s online group reservation form. The dataset does not account for changes made between online booking and arrival at the mountain.</p>
        
         <h2>Question 4: Who are our groups? Revenue by Industry:</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/14.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>Churches, Wholesalers, and Family Groups supplied the greatest revenue of all industry types. March 2015 featured high revenue across all industries. Higher Education groups purchased the most during January. Consider college promotions in January.</p>
    
        <h2>Question 5: Which groups generate the most revenue and bring the most skiers to the mountain?</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/18.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>God bless Tommy Query. Note that more skiers does not necessarily correlate with higher revenue. How can we encourage wholesalers to promote Monarch’s rental packages?</p>
    
        <h2>Question 6: How many skiers are coming to the mountain via Group Sales? How does skier count relate to revenue throughout the season?</h2>
        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/30.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>

         <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/24.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>

        <iframe width="800" height="550" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~AAbercrombie0492/32.embed?width=800&height=550"></iframe>
        <p>Opportunities from the dataset are indexed by their first ski date. Gross skier count on any given day in the time series accounts for groups starting their visit on said day. A group with 20 skiers that arrives on the mountain March 1, 2015 but stays at Monarch for 3 days will only factor into the gross skier count of March 1, not March 2 or March 3.</p>
